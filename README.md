Here are drivers/apps I use with my HE. They are created by other brainy people but some of them are a bit adjusted by me just to suit my needs.
EM Enhanced Z-Wave Thermostat is an example - Even More Enhanced Z-Wave Thermostat is a driver with temeratureUp() and temperatureDown() methods one can create custom commands with and use them in RM. Good for Spirit Z-Wave TRV.
